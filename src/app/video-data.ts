    "Do you remember signing up for a Facebook account? I was 12, and I didn‚Äôt even have an email, so I made that first while my brother snapped a picture of me on his now-ancient Samsung for my inaugural PFP (dire). Fast forward a decade, and social media platforms have morphed from a leisurely pastime into a virtual lifeline we seemingly can't do without. But how did we arrive at this junction where life without our smartphones seems inconceivable? Why are we consumed by the incessant need to be connected, as if disconnecting would mean missing out on a life-altering story, event, lifestyle, moment, or idea? "

    'The reason I ‚Äî and many, many others ‚Äî have the pervasive sensation of being tethered to our smartphones stems from the fact that someone, somewhere, profits from our digital engagement. But how does this process unfold, and what are the consequences of such exploitation? This project seeks to examines the roots of digital capital, its impact on society, and the ways in which it both shapes and reinforces systems of oppression. Specifically, it traces the creation of digital capital, analyzes the political economy of digital commodification and surveillance, and explores how we can imagine our way out of ‚Äòtechnological redlining‚Äô and the new Jim Code.'

    content:
    "Data collection lies at the heart of technocracy, with our social media interfaces acting as insatiable black holes, indiscriminately devouring every bit of information they encounter. Each like, comment, share, upload, download, text, tweet, photo, swipe, or interaction you've ever made has been digitized and stored away on some distant database. In the digital realm, tech companies emerge as the dragons of digital capitalism, amassing vast troves of data and fiercely guarding their hoard against governments, users, and other tech giants. It is through this relentless digitization of our actions that software companies convert our daily lives into private property for their own accumulation. And thus, a resounding truth reverberates across the digital landscape: if an app is free, you are the product."

    'An evocative and compelling image illustrating the parallels between digital and physical private property, focusing on the processes of extraction, ownership, and exploitation. The composition showcases a split scene, where one half depicts a vast mining operation, representing the exploitation of land and resources, while the other half features an abstract visualization of data mining, symbolizing the extraction of user data in the digital world. The central figure in the image is a set of intertwined chains, connecting the two halves and signifying the inextricable link between the exploitation of land and data. These chains also represent the manufactured scarcity that perpetuates race and class divisions in society. The color palette consists of muted earth tones, emphasizing the notion that these processes serve to reinforce systems of oppression. This powerful image sets the stage for a deeper exploration of racialized data analysis and the consequences of monetizing digital property, as the viewer is invited to reflect on the ways in which digital and physical exploitation are interconnected.',
    content:
    "Digital and physical private property are related by the processes of extraction, ownership, and exploitation. In terms of geo-logics, the mining of land and mining of data are inextricably linked. If data analysis aims to create surplus value from human-computer interactions, then the end goals of exploiting data are the same as making land productive; to manufacture scarcity as a means of reproducing race and class. The value extracted from data is dependent on furthering systems of oppression, and it is through data analysis that we see the codifying of race as technology in digital systems. In the subsequent sections, we will delve into specific examples of racialized data analysis and examine the consequences of monetizing digital property."

    "A thought-provoking and impactful image that visually represents the concept of Digital Epidermalization, highlighting the subtle attribution of racial identity through digital information and activity. The composition showcases an array of seemingly unrelated personal details such as names, postal codes, and online interactions, gradually forming the contours of a human face that symbolizes the construction of racial identity. The image is rendered in a muted black-and-white color palette, underscoring the deceptive simplicity of these data points and their potential to reveal and perpetuate racial inequalities. Shadowy figures in the background represent various institutions, including insurance companies, legal systems, job recruiters, advertising agencies, and banks, who exploit this information for their own discriminatory purposes. This striking visual prompt invites the viewer to consider the implications of Digital Epidermalization and its impact on marginalized communities, setting the stage for further discussion on the consequences of heightened surveillance and data collection practices.",
    content:
    "The process of Digital Epidermalization involves attributing racial identity through the lens of digital information and activity. As highlighted by Benjamin (2019), while companies are not explicitly permitted to gather data on a user's race, they can easily extract such information from seemingly innocuous details like names and postal codes. Consequently, Black users are subjected to heightened surveillance and data collection, fuelling the discriminatory practices of insurance companies, legal systems, job recruiters, advertising agencies, and banks that base decisions on users' racial identities."

    'An evocative and visually compelling image that highlights the concept of "Racialized Surveillance" in the context of both historical and modern forms, designed to fit the background of a phone app feed. The image showcases a split scene, contrasting the 18th-century Lantern Laws with contemporary surveillance technology in low-income neighborhoods, predominantly inhabited by Black or other communities of color. On one side, the image portrays the historical scenario, with a dark, candlelit street and silhouettes of Black, Indigenous, and racialized people carrying lanterns, emphasizing the oppressive nature of Lantern Laws. On the other side, the image transitions to a modern urban environment, illuminated by harsh floodlights and dotted with surveillance cameras, signifying the continuation of racialized surveillance practices. The image uses a monochromatic color scheme, with subtle shades of gray and black to emphasize the stark contrast between the two scenes, while maintaining a cohesive visual aesthetic. This composition powerfully conveys the persistent and evolving nature of racialized surveillance, challenging viewers to question the role of technology in perpetuating racial inequalities and stereotypes.',
    content:
    "This modern form of racialized surveillance has deep historical roots. In the 18th century, ‚ÄòLantern Laws‚Äô in New York city mandated that Black, Indigenous, and radicalized people carry candle lanterns in the streets after dark when not accompanied by a white person. The legacy of lantern laws can be seen in the contemporary use of floodlights and surveillance technology in low-income neighbourhoods, which are often predominantly Black or other communities of colour. The use of such technologies in turn constructs Blackness as a threat that justifies increased policing and surveillance. "

",
    content:
    'While laws and practices in the past overtly promoted segregation to maintain racial hierarchies, companies today are more focused on cultivating ‚Äòdiverse‚Äô markets to cultivate profits. Through processes like digital epidermalization, tech companies cement group identities as fixed and unwavering aspects of society, fostering a deceptive sense of belonging and visibility for consumers in the mass market. The fabrication of digital cultural identity, as a means to tailor marketing strategies for users, demonstrates the adaptability of race as a technology used to sort, organize, and construct social structures in the digital realm. In doing so, companies monetize and encode differences beyond legal frameworks in a process aptly termed "technological redlining" by Safiya Noble. This phenomenon reveals how the dynamics of race and power persist and evolve in the digital landscape.'
