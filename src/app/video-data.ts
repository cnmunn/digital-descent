    'Do you remember signing up for a Facebook account? I was 12, and I didn’t even have an email, so I had to make that first while my brother took a picture of me on an ancient Samsung for my first ever PFP (dire). In the past 10 years, social media apps have turned from something we did for fun into something we seemingly partake in to survive. But how have did get to a point where we feel like we can’t live without our phones? Why do we feel like we constantly have to be online all the time, as though there’s a story, event, lifestyle, moment, or idea that we’re missing when we disconnect?'

    'The reason I — and many, many others — feel this way is because somebody is making money off of us. But how? And what are the implications of them doing so? This project seeks to examine the origins of digital capital, its impact on society, and the ways in which it has been shaped by and reinforces systems of oppression. Specifically, we will trace the creation of digital capital, analyze the political economy of digital commodification and surveillance, and explore how we can imagine our way out of ‘technological redlining’ and the new Jim Code.'

    'Digital capital refers to the value and resources generated in the digital realm, primarily through the collection, analysis, and monetization of data. In the context of digital capitalism, digital capital encompasses various forms of assets, such as user data, algorithms, and software. The process of collection is routine, accumulated daily through our interactions with social media where every interaction is recorded. Driven by accumulation, surplus value is generated through analysis, whereby additional information about the user is synthesized. '

    'Data collection is the driving force behind technocracy. In this process, our social media interfaces act as black holes, consuming everything possible without discernment. Every like, comment, share, upload, download, text, tweet, photo, swipe, or interaction you’ve ever made has been converted into 0s and 1s living on a database somewhere. In this regard, tech companies are the dragons of digital capitalism, hoarding massive amounts of data and burning anyone who comes close to touching it. It is through the digitization of actions that software companies are therefore capable of turning our daily lives into private property to be accumulated.'

    'As highlighted by Benjamin (2019), companies are not allowed to collect data on someone’s race, but they can derive such information from the user’s name, postal code, family members, and writing. This additional information enables tech companies to know which ads will make the most money off of you, as well as which post to show you next so you keep swiping. This gives rise to the resounding truth of all online platforms: if an app is free, then you are the product. '

      'In the 18th century, ‘Lantern Laws’ in New York city mandated that Black, Indigenous, and racialized people carry candle lanterns in the streets after dark when not accompanied by a white person. The legacy of lantern laws can be seen in the contemporary use of floodlights and surveillance technology in low-income neighbourhoods, which are often predominantly Black or other communities of colour. The use of such technologies in turn constructs Blackness as a threat that justifies increased policing and surveillance.',
